```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}


foo = function(a, min_new, max_new) {

  
  min_a <- min(a)
  max_a <- max(a)
  
  normalized <- ((a - min_a) / (max_a - min_a)) * (max_new - min_new) + min_new
  
  return(normalized)
}

```



# Test with your age data
```{r}
age = c(13, 15, 16, 16, 19, 20, 20, 21, 22, 22, 25, 25, 25, 25,
         30, 33, 33, 35, 35, 35, 35, 36, 40, 45, 46, 52, 70)
```



# Map between 0 and 1
```{r}
foo(age, 0, 1)
```



# Map between 10 and 50
```{r}
foo(age, 10, 50)
```





```{r }

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
